        <h2>Content:</h2>
        <p>Here is my blog post about my coding class update. I am enjoying the class and being challenged every day.
            My favorite thing that I have learned so far is JavaScript. It makes more sense to me than CSS. This week we
            are going to learn Bootstrap by Twitter, so that should help me with the design aspect of coding that is more
            difficult. I can't wait to see my progress at the end of the class.

        <h2>Title: My Reading Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Content:</h2>
        <p>This year, I challenged myself to read 30 books. It's the end of March and I've only read one so far, but it was 
            a really long book. I might cheat a little bit and count it as two or even three separate books.

        <h2>Content:</h2>
        <p>My favorite snacks are cheese, sour cream, ice cream, yogurt, turkey slices, and ranch. A good rule of thumb is that if it 
            is made of dairy, the smell will be so tantalizing. Another recent discovery is chocolate pudding, but my mom says that I 
            really can't have a lot of that one. To be honest, none of my favorite snacks are very good for me and sometimes after I get
            to eat them, my stomach starts to hurt. #lactoseintolerantstruggles

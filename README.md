# Personal Blog with Web APIs

## Description

This webpage first presents you with a form to fill out that allows you to write a blog post. Upon clicking the "Post" button, the entries are saved to Local Storage and renders it on another page. The biggest challenge I faced while creating this application was the design aspect. I had to figure out how to format both the form page and blog page to be easy to navigate as a user. Figuring out how to save the information entered into local storage and then having it rendered on the next page was also a challenge.
